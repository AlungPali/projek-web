            <P>Kantaw Esports was founded in early 2022 by a man who often plays games. Kantaw is taken from the Suayan language which means stupid. Yeah... just like the name esports this guy is also stupid in playing games, especially in the valorant game
                which is currently trending. but with strong intentions and enthusiasm, this man was determined to create an esports team called KTW (kantaw). This young man's goal is simple, just to stay in touch with his stupid friends too.</P>
